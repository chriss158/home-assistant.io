Click the "Add Card" button in the bottom right corner and select **Conditional** from the card picker. All options for this card can be configured via the user interface.

### Link between conditions

Conditions can be either linked with `and` or with `or`. This can be set via the `link_conditions` configuration. 
 - If the conditions are linked with `and`, then **all** entities must meet the state requriements.
 - If the conditions are linked with `or`, then only **one** entity of all entities must meet the state requirement.

## Examples

```yaml
type: conditional
conditions:
  - entity: light.bed_light
    state: "on"
  - entity: switch.decorative_lights
    state_not: "off"
card:
  type: entities
  entities:
    - device_tracker.demo_paulus
    - cover.kitchen_window
    - group.kitchen
    - lock.kitchen_door
    - light.bed_light
```
